141030  -  add these 2 rules

1:  declaratin with assignment  for  stuff like

type id "=" exp 


this is on a higher level and another way of defining/declaring a variable. it does not conflict with the general 16 rules for exp



2:  parenthesis general

Exp ::= "(" Exp ")"   

TA surprised this was not on the page. says stuff like (((x))) should def be allowed, and this is a rule we can add.
